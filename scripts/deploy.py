1. Create a new repository on GitHub (or GitLab/Bitbucket) and push your code.
2. Log in to your Render account.
3. Click "New" and select "Blueprint" from the dropdown menu.
4. Connect your repository.
5. Render will automatically detect the render.yaml file and set up your service.
6. Click "Apply" to start the deployment.
7. Once deployed, you can access your web app at the URL provided by Render.

### Important Notes
- The free tier has limitations and your app will spin down after inactivity.
- Your bot needs to run in a headless mode (already configured in main.py).
- You may need to install additional dependencies for Chrome to run in a Linux environment.

6. Once deployed, you can access your web app at the URL provided by Railway.

### Important Notes
- Railway provides a generous free tier but requires a credit card for verification.
- Your bot needs to run in a headless mode (already configured in main.py).
- You may need to add environment variables through the Railway dashboard.

1. Sign up for a free PythonAnywhere account.
2. Go to the "Web" tab and add a new web app.
3. Select "Manual configuration" and choose Python 3.8.
4. Set the path to your web app: /home/yourusername/easyapply_app
5. Click on "Files" and upload your project files or clone from a repository.
6. Open a Bash console and navigate to your project directory.
7. Create a virtual environment: `python -m venv venv`
8. Activate it: `source venv/bin/activate`
9. Install requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
10. Go back to the "Web" tab and:
   - Set the WSGI configuration file to point to your wsgi.py
   - Set the working directory to your project directory
   - Add an environment variable: PYTHONPATH with value /home/yourusername/easyapply_app
11. Reload your web app.

### Important Notes
- PythonAnywhere free accounts have limitations on outbound connections.
- You may need to use PythonAnywhere's Selenium wrapper or pay for a premium account to use Selenium.
- Schedule your bot to run with the PythonAnywhere task scheduler.
